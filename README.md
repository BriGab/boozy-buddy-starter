# Node/Express/MySQL/AJAX Boozy Buddy (Drink Diary) Starter Code

Starter code for DU Coding Boot Camp Node/Express/MySQL/AJAX Review Session. During this session we'll create a database and table and connect to it using the `mysql` npm package. We'll then build out GET and POST routes to read and write data to our table. We will also wire up the front-end JavaScript logic to interact with our routes.

The app will allow the user to add drinks of various types, to view drinks sorted by rating, and to view all "Loved" and "Hated" drinks sorted alphabetically.

## Getting Started

Fork and then clone this repo; we'll follow the comments in key files to piece together the app's functionality.
